1. LICENCE
MYTHICSOFT, the author and owner of "FILELOCATOR PRO" (the SOFTWARE, as defined above), grants YOU the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use one copy (or multiple copies, as applicable) of the SOFTWARE on one Operating Server Environment ("OSE") at any one time for each licence purchased.

You may not modify the SOFTWARE or disable any licensing or control features of the SOFTWARE except as an intended part of the SOFTWARE’s programming features or functionality. 

Single User Licence.  A single user licence will license one copy of the SOFTWARE for USE on one OSE by a single user.  It does not permit the USE of the SOFTWARE by anyone other than the named individual LICENSEE.

Multi-User Licence. A multi-user licence will license the specified acquired number of copies of the SOFTWARE for USE on one OSE per named user. A multi-user licence is not a concurrent licence: each user of the SOFTWARE must be individually licensed to USE the SOFTWARE. For situations where multiple users need to USE the SOFTWARE on multiple OSEs YOU need to acquire a license for each OSE or each user, whichever is greater.

Multi-User licensing example: Ten users using the SOFTWARE on twenty OSEs requires twenty licenses. Ten users using the SOFTWARE on five OSEs requires ten licenses. One user using the SOFTWARE on fifty OSEs requires fifty licenses.
