** Introduction **

Welcome to FileLocator Pro the professional file searching utility.

FileLocator Pro is a tool for finding files and information on your hard drive fast and efficiently.

FileLocator Pro provides compelling advantages over similar search tools:
- Regular expressions that allow complex rule based searches.
- Immediate contents results view.
- Various wizards to walk the user through the searching process.

FileLocator Pro can be used as a replacement or a companion to the standard Windows Search. FileLocator Pro provides both a basic interface, similar to the Find feature found in Windows 2000, and a more advanced interface (the default) for the 'Expert user'. Both interfaces provide Wizards to walk the user through the searching process.

Users familiar with the UNIX GREP command will appreciate the ability to search the contents of files using regular expressions and be able to view found contents without having to open the files.
