
4.3.5b
------
  Changes for users

    * Added a pipe plugin.

    * Fixed: when ESC[J was output in a line at the bottom of the terminal,
      the line is erased entirely.

    * Fixed: application crashes if options.conf was empty.

    * Fixed: application crashes when a socket was closed
      or disconnected just before a keep-alive packet will be sent.

    * When the preferences are saved to .conf file,
      the previous .conf file is preserved as .conf.prev file.

    * Some fixes and improvements about buttons in tab bar.
      - Text color when the button was pressed was changed to
        the normal text color.
      - Ellipsis is displayed correctly.
      - Default UI font is used to display text.
      - Updating text would be done more stable and reliable.

    * Added limitation to the prompt recognition.
      In default, recognizer searches a prompt up to 5 lines backward.
      Hence a command line that exceeds 5 lines will not be recognized.
      This limitation improves performance when a large continuous
      text is displayed.

      It affects to the "shell complement", "popup command result"
      and "copy command result" feature.

      The limitation parameter can be changed in the preference editor.
      (org.poderosa.terminalemulator.promptrecognizer.promptSearchMaxLines)

    * Portforwarding tool: Improved window placement on startup.
      It guarantees that the window and its titlebar are displayed
      in the desktop region.

  Changes for developers

    * Extension points
      "org.poderosa.terminalsessions.telnetSSHLoginDialogUISupport" and
      "org.poderosa.terminalsessions.cygwinLoginDialogUISupport"
      were integrated to
      "org.poderosa.terminalsessions.loginDialogUISupport".

      Previously MRU extension has been registered to these extension points,
      but the protocol-specific extension points makes MRU extension
      difficult to use from other plugins except Telnet/SSH/Cygwin plugin.


4.3.4b
------
  Changes for users

    * "Auto Exec Macro" functionality was added to the Telnet/SSH/
      Cygwin/SerialPort login.
      Samples for auto-exec macro were also added to Macro\Sample directory.

    * New methods ShowTraceWindow() and HideTraceWindow() were added
      to Poderosa.Macro.DebugService.
      You can control visibility of a trace window in your macro.

    * New methods ReceiveData(int) and ReceiveLine(int) were added
      to Poderosa.Macro.Connection.
      These methods take a timeout argument.

    * Fixed a bug that the terminal doesn't shutdown properly.
      This bug was introduced in 4.3.3b.

    * Fixed and refactored the serial port communication.
      The SerialPort plugin will work in 64bit CLR.

    * Fixed a bug that the input character U+0080 - U+00FF is sent
      without proper character-encoding conversion.

    * Credit dialog uses default font instead of "MS UI Gothic".

    * Some dialogs were fixed so that they can close by pressing ESC key.

  Changes for developers

    * Macro API document is available.

    * "Developer's Manual" conceptual content was added into
      the Japanese API document.

      The conceptual content were imported from PoderosaDeveloperManual.chm
      which was distributed with 4.1.0.
      "Developer's Manual" was written in Japanese, so only Japanese API
      document contains "Developer's Manual" section.

    * References to NUnit were removed from projects because
      conditional reference causes error in the VS form designer.

    * Accessibility of a class SimpleStringEncrypt was changed to internal.


4.3.3b
------
  Changes for users

    * Xterm 256 colors or aixterm 16 colors are supported.
      The patch was contributed by Iwamoto Koichi.

    * Tab switching functionality was added.
      You can bind shortcut key to "Previous tab" or "Next tab"
      in Tools -> Options -> Command.

    * Improved window placement on startup.
      It guarantees that the window and its titlebar are displayed
      in the desktop region.

    * Added new SSH private-key loader.
      It supports SSH.com(SECSH), OpenSSH and PuTTY format.
      It would be beta quality and needs more tests.

    * Fixed decryption of the SSH1 private key.
      Now Poderosa can open the SSH1 private key encrypted
      in TripleDES.

    * Fixed erasing characters to satisfy BCE (Back-Color-Erase).

    * Fixed escape sequence detection. ESC \ is recognized as
      an OSC terminator.

    * Fixed NAWS (Negotiate About Window Size) parameters in
      TELNET protocol.
      Width or height larger than 255 are set correctly.

    * For supporting .NET 2.0 no-SP environment, Font.OriginalFontName
      is used only when it was available.
      Otherwise Font.FontFamily.Name is used.

  Changes for developers

    * API reference can be generated as a .chm file
      by using Sandcastle Help File Builder.

    * 'MakeDoc' and 'XMLDocument' configurations were removed,
      and creating XML documentation files were enabled as the default
      in all configurations.
      If you don't want XML documentation, disable it manually.


4.3.2b
------
    * Fixed encoding mismatch of the portforwarding.conf.

      Encoding of the portforwarding.conf was changed to the system default
      encoding instead of UTF-8.

      Old config file is supported limitedly.
      If the content of portforwarding.conf was invalid as the system default
      encoding, UTF-8 is used to read the file.

    * Halfwidth hanguls and halfwidth symbols are displayed in narrow width.

    * Fixed "erasing line" so that the current decorations are applied
      on the erased area.

    * Fixed "deleting/inserting chars" so that the current decorations
      are applied on the new empty spaces.

    * Fixed memory leak when a context menu was used.


4.3.1b
------
    * Improved repainting of the terminal view.

      It seems to be stable.
      Some incorrect paint might occur, but correct result will
      be painted after them.

    * Support 64bit environment in cygwin directory determination.

    * In SerialPort plugin, unexpected port name is ignored for
      avoiding problem.
      The patch was contributed by Iwamoto Koichi.

    * Show alert when the new-line character will be pasted.
      It is enabled by default, and can be disabled in the terminal option.

    * Fixed closing process of the terminal object.
      Log files are closed when the session was terminated from UI.

    * Improved emulation of the xterm's buffer switch.
      In "save/restore DEC private modes" function, only the state of
      buffer switch is supported.

    * Fixed "save/restore cursor" in xterm.
      Now cursor position is saved related to the current buffer.

    * Fixed "scroll-up/scroll-down" in xterm.


4.3.0b
------
  Changes for users

    * The default preference directory was changed to the user's
      application-data directory.
      If you want to save files to the exe directory,
      add '--profile bindir' to the command line.

    * Suitable terminal size calculation.

    * More encodings for asian languages.

    * Improved ISO-2022 decoding.

    * Japanese-specific settings were changed to CJK-specific settings.

    * CJK environment detection. (experimental)

    * Improvements based on xjzhang1979's hack.
      - Serializing passphrase in encrypted or plain text.
        To use this feature, turn the following parameters true
        in the preference editor.

            org.poderosa.protocols.readSerializedPassword

            org.poderosa.protocols.savePassword
         or org.poderosa.protocols.savePlainTextPassword

      - Line-spacing
      - More placement mode of the background image
      - Bold caret
      - Force-bold font option
      - Cygwin directory option
        (If it was empty, the directory is detected from the registry)
      - Terminal type can select in the cygwin login.
      - Support more escape sequences in the xterm mode.
      - Some bug fixes

    * The following SSH2 cipher algorithms were added:
        AES192-CBC/AES256-CBC/AES128-CTR/AES192-CTR/AES256-CTR
      This improvement was based on the Iwamoto Koichi's patch.

    * Update cygterm to Cygterm+ 1.07 pl 20

    * Encoding can select in the cygwin login.
      The default is UTF-8.

    * Fixed: cygterm cannot connect anymore after the first attempt
      of connection was failed.

    * Fixed: a failure of the keyboard-interactive mode is not
      handled properly.

  Changes for developers

    * All Forms or UserControls can open with the form designer.
      Use "Debug(UIDesign)" configuration for viewing or editing Forms.
      Note that some Forms or UserControls may not be able to edit safely
      because hand-edited codes are still there.

  Known bugs

    * Sometimes fails to repaint received lines...

    * Portforwarding's conf file is saved in inappropriate encoding ?
